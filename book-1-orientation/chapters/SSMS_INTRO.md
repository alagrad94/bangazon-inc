# SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

SSMS is the client tool used to connect to the SQL Server Database Management System. It provides facilities to create, view, edit and remove databases, tables within those databases, and data within tables.

## Main parts of SSMS

Below are some of the most important components of SSMS.

### Object Explorer

The object explorer provides a tree-view that displays the databases within SQL Server and allows the user to explore tables (and other objects) within those databases.

### Query Window

The query window is a SQL text editor used to perform queries and other operations within a particular database.

### Results / Messages Panel

The results panel displayes a grid containing query results from the most recently executed query.

The messages panel shows confirmation and/or error messages from the most recently run SQL command or query.
